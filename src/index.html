                Press release<br>
                Title: Two students of Doon University received Young Scientist Awards<br>
                In a remarkable feat of academic expertise, Doon University's research scholars, Avantika Gaur (School
                of Technology) has been honored with the prestigious Young Scientist Award at the 18th Uttarakhand
                State
                Science and Technology Congress (USSTC 2024) by Hon'ble Governor Uttarakhand. The esteemed event took
                place on February 8th-9th, 2024, celebrating excellence and innovation in the field of science and
                technology. The valedictory ceremony was organized on the occasion of National Science Day on Feb 28,
                2024 at Vigyan Dham.

                Ms. Avantika Gaur, a research scholar at the Department of Computer Science under the mentorship of
                Dr.
                Preeti Mishra, demonstrated commendable skills and dedication in her research endeavors. She has
                contributed significantly as a Junior Research Fellow (JRF) in a cyber security research project
                funded
                by Data Security Council of India (DSCI). Her work reflects a profound understanding of adversarial
                machine learning, explainable artificial intelligence for developing the security solution in the
                virtualization environment.

                The Young Scientist Award not only recognizes the remarkable achievements of Avantika Gaur and Kavita
                Mishra but also underscores the commitment of Doon University to foster a culture of academic
                excellence
                and research innovation
