            <strong>Project Description:</strong> Security holds great
            significance in this new era of on-demand virtual computing. As
            software and hardware update daily, malware is also modifying its
            behaviour rapidly. Some researchers are still working in this area
            to handle the recent cyber-attacks in critical virtualization
            ecosystems. The existing research works may not be suitable with the
            existing updated virtualization environment as they have been
            validated with older datasets. In this project, a deep neural
            network (DNN) based malware (Trojan) detection approach has been
            proposed and implemented, called DeepHyperv, to detect the malware
            threats in a virtualization environment by doing the deep virtual
            memory analysis. Direct access to the analysis components is
            prohibited in the proposed architecture by deploying them inside the
            privileged domain of the hypervisor. The process execution logs are
            collected at the hypervisor using the memory introspection technique
            with the support of recent hardware and software configurations of
            analysis setup and virtualization environment. The logs are
            pre-processed and converted into a discrete feature vector matrix.
            The approach uses DNN to learn & test the extracted features at the
            hypervisor. The approach is validated in the test bed setup of our
            lab, and results seem to promising.

            <strong>datasets:</strong> A malware dataset (in the form of exe) is
            taken from San Jose State University (SJSU) on request. Some of the
            benign applications have been downloaded from SourceForge and some
            of them are taken from system32 folder of Windows system. In the
            first scenario, 2592 benign samples and 9896 malware samples are
            considered (termed HyperMalware) and in the later scenario 25000
            malware samples and 20000 benign samples have been considered
            (termed HyperMalware’).

            <strong>Project Description:</strong> The security concerns in
            virtualization are the central issue for the researchers as well as
            organizations. Attackers use different tactics to exploit the
            vulnerabilities present in virtual components. In this paper, we
            provide a detailed study on the malware families & along with their
            impact on virtualization. In addition, malware log extraction using
            deep memory introspection has been explored. Various plugins have
            been explained, along with the variety of features that are
            essential for malware analysis purposes. A case study has also been
            provided using the testbed set up in our lab to provide the
            practical insight on deep memory introspection using open-source
            tools, along with their usage to extract different features outside
            the VM at the hypervisor. We hope that our work will help readers to
            understand the malware logs and extract important features for
            malware analysis in a virtual environment.

            <strong>Project Description:</strong> Cloud computing has become
            very popular and extremely demanding in the market. Several emerging
            technologies such as Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT),
            microservices and Bigdata analytics etc. are adopting cloud
            computing due to the availability of the high-end computing servers.
            However, security breaches have also started to grow along with its
            popularity. The advanced malware can target virtualization-based
            infrastructure and can harm virtual resources and thereby becoming
            threat to industrial applications & data hosted in cloud. The modern
            malware is difficult to be detected by using traditional security
            tools. In this project, an introspection-assisted evolutionary
            bag-of-ngram approach is proposed, named as vServiceInspector for
            doing process monitoring from both inside the virtual machine
            (In-VM) & outside virtual machine (Out-VM). It employs advanced
            memory introspection to extract the system call sequences at Out-VM
            location (i.e. hypervisor). Genetic Algorithm (GA) is employed to
            find the most discriminating sequences of system calls and extract
            optimal feature set. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a deep
            learning algorithm is then used to learn and detect the malicious
            program execution patterns. An accuracy of 83.13%–99.63% is achieved
            by using University of New Mexico (UNM) dataset and an accuracy of
            97.8%–99% is achieved by using University of California (Barecloud)
            dataset. The vServiceInspector is more accurate and more attack
            resilient when compared to previously proposed techniques.
          </p>

            <strong>datasets Used:</strong> vServiceInspector dataset provided
            by the University of New Mexico through their repositories and
            Barecloud dataset from University of California are being used here.

            <strong>Project Description:</strong> With the advent of
            technologies such as the internet of things (IoT), big Data
            analytics, and cloud computing; most businesses have adopted
            virtualization technologies. Virtualization is a key technology that
            enables the execution of multiple operating systems in one physical
            machine, thereby allowing the sharing of resources within the same
            environment. The pay-per-use and on-demand sharing of resources,
            have increased the utilization of cloud-based services, thereby
            increasing various security concerns. There are various attacks
            possible at different cloud computing layers i.e.,
            application-layer, virtualization-layer, network-layer,
            hardware-layer etc. In this project, we have explored various
            attacking possibilities and defensive tools, specially focusing on
            network-layer of cloud computing. Various traditional security
            solutions such as Network Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS) and
            Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) are used by researchers to
            protect cloud from network attacks. To effectively secure network
            layer, these traditional tools are no longer sufficient. One has to
            relentlessly search for tools that specifically focus on
            virtualization layer of cloud. Cloud design architecture differs
            significantly from traditional network design architectures.
            Moreover, there are different design constraints at different layers
            of cloud. Therefore, the same tool cannot be deployed at all layers.
            Hence, it is crucial to classify all the tools according to the
            layered architecture of cloud. In this project, we have discussed
            different security and attacking tools, providing a detailed study
            of the tools. Each of the category is further classified based on
            target layer of deployment at the virtualization layer.

            <strong>Project Description:</strong> In recent years,
            virtualization has become popular with the usage of emerging
            technologies in different domains. With the increasing number of
            attacking incidents in recent times, virtualization security has
            become one of the primary focus of research. The traditional network
            attack detection systems are inefficient enough to detect attacks
            over the virtual network. In this project, we have proposed a
            virtual network security framework, called VNSecure that detects
            malicious network activities by analysing virtual machine (VM)
            traffic profile. VNsecure operates on a hypervisor layer and has
            access to both underlying hardware and guest operating system. It
            does VM-level activity analysis from the privileged domain of the
            hypervisor, serving as the main line of defence against intrusions
            at the virtual network level. Initially, VM traffic validation is
            performed to detect spoofing attacks by analysing the traffic
            captured at the backend driver of the virtual network interface of
            the monitored VM. To perform detailed behaviour analysis, a deep
            learning approach is used to learn and detect VM-specific network
            attacks. On detection of malicious traffic, an alert is raised to
            the administrator. VNSecure then carries out essential mitigation to
            lower the risk and store the occurrence of malicious packets in its
            database.

            <strong>Project Description:</strong> Cyber-attacking incidents have
            been increasing day by day along with the technological growth in
            the era of post-COVID. Due to the evolving behaviour of the attacks,
            it has become difficult for traditional security tools to capture
            the stealthy new attack patterns. In this project a thorough study
            on various advanced techniques for intrusion detection, has been
            carried out. An intrusion detection system (IDS) can be considered
            as effective system if it possesses the following key features:
            robustness, efficiency, and interpretability. Adversarial Machine
            Learning (AML) is an advanced field of study that help to improve
            the robustness. Likewise, optimization methods help in achieving the
            good efficiency, and explainable AI (XAI) assist in improving the
            interpretability of IDS results. All these approaches are well
            investigated and compared in the project to give a direction to
            researchers working in the area of intrusion detection system. At
            the end, a case study on malware detection has been performed and
            the use of XAI libraries such as SHAP and LIME libraries has been
            demonstrated to interpret the IDS results.

            <strong>Project Description:</strong> Cloud computing provides
            delivery of computing resources as a service on a pay-as-you-go
            basis. It represents a shift from products being purchased, to
            products being subscribed as a service, delivered to consumers over
            the internet from a large scale data centre. The main issue with
            cloud services is security from attackers who can easily compromise
            the Virtual Machines (VMs) and applications running over it. In this
            project, we present a HyperGuard mechanism to detect malware attacks
            which hide their presence by sensing the analyzing environment or
            security tools installed in VMs. They may attach themselves with the
            legitimate processes. Hence, HyperGuard is deployed at the
            hypervisor, outside the monitored VMs to detect such evasive
            attacks. It employs open-source introspection libraries to capture
            the VM behaviour from hypervisor inform of syscall logs. It extracts
            the features in form of n-grams. It makes use of Recursive Feature
            Elimination (RFE) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to learn and
            detect the abnormal behaviour of evasive malware. The approach has
